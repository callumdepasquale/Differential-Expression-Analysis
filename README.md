# Differential Expression Analysis

This project explores the expression levels of key breast cancer–related genes using publicly available RNA-seq data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). 
It extends the “Gene Expression” tutorials by Bioinformagician with additional visualisations and statistical tests. 
The analysis includes:
    Loading and preprocessing FPKM expression data (GSE183947)
    Retrieving sample metadata from GEO 
    Visualising gene expression patterns (barplots, boxplots, heatmaps, scatterplots, density plots)
    Performing statistical comparison (e.g., Wilcoxon rank-sum test) to evaluate expression differences by metastasis status
